# Linux Basics Chapter 1!
Hi everyone! 👋  
Welcome to lesson 1️⃣ on Linux basic
commands. You’ll learn how to navigate in Linux using the command line.


**Getting started  
LINUX**   
I’ll be using **Ubuntu 22-04 LTS** on my Windows
desktop. You can also download previous versions of Ubuntu. The command lines and
prompts will be usable on earlier and future versions as well.  
Set up your
username and use a simple password like your name or 1234. 

**Structure**   
After
setting your username and password, you will see something like this on the
screen: 
<pre> molly_k@DESKTOP-MBJ059:~$ </pre>

You might see **$** or **#**
depending on your system. Here “ **molly_k** ” is my username.   
You need to be careful
about being case-sensitive while working on Ubuntu.   
A and a are not the same
thing! ⚠️ So, keep this in mind while working. 

The `~` signifies that you're
in your home directory, where all non-system files are stored. 

N.B. In UNIX,
we call folders as directories.

**NAVIGATION**  
How to navigate like a pro! 😄 

You need to know a few basic navigation commands to find your way while
working. 

**mkdir**     
`mkdir` i.e. make directory is used to create a new
directory.  
You can choose any name for your directory. Here I’m using linux (directory
name).   
<pre>~$ mkdir linux </pre>

**ls**     
`ls` is used to list down all
the content present in your current. It gives you a list of sub-directories and
files.  
<pre>~$ ls
linux </pre>

**cd**     
`cd` stands for change directory
which literally means to change directory. When you have multiple directories,
you can use `cd` to open other directories and navigate in and between them.  

<pre>~$ cd linux  
~/linux$ </pre> 

`cd linux` allows me to move into the linux
direcotry. But what if I want to move back to my home directory?

**cd ..**   

I can go back to my home directory, using `cd ..` since it's a step behind me.  

<pre>~/linux$ cd ..  
~$ </pre>

**pwd**    
pwd (print working directory)
prints the full path i.e. the full path of the directory you are currently in.
Since, the name of the directory is linux the command line shows full address like
below.   
<pre>~/linux$ pwd  
/home/molly_k/linux </pre>

**nano**     
Do you
want to create and edit a text file? Use nano to create a text file.
`nano` is a
Linux-terminal-specific text editor.
<pre>~$ nano mk.txt </pre>

1. A new window
will open.
2. Type your text. (I typed My name is Molly)  And press Ctrl + O
3.
Type in the name of your file if you didn't provide it (only typed `nano`). But
if you did, it'll already have a name (like it does in my case i.e. mk.txt).
4.
Press the Enter key to confirm your saving then text file with your desired
name.
5. Press Ctrl + X to exit the text editor and return to your
directory.

**cat**     
To see the text content of your text file you can use this command. 

<pre>~$ cat mk.txt  
My name is Molly.  
~$ </pre>

**echo**  
It prints out
whatever you type on the terminal.  
<pre>~$ echo “hi molly”   
hi molly </pre>


**grep**     
If you want to search a particular word from the contents of a file
you can use grep.   
<pre>~$ grep “name” molly.txt   
My *name* is Molly.
</pre>

**rm**   
To remove files, you can use this prompt.   
⚠️ But be careful while
using rm! ⚠️  
<pre>~$ ls   
linux   mk.txt  
~$ rm mk.txt   
~$
</pre>

**rmdir**   
rm alone is not enough to remove directories, you need to use rmdir which
is to remove (empty) directories    
⚠️ But be careful while using rmdir! ⚠️  

<pre>~$ rmdir linux  
~$ </pre>


See you for the next lesson! 😄 👋
